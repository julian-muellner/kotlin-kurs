/**
 * Demo 9 - Context parameters.
 *
 * A stable language feature since Kotlin 2.4; it needs NO compiler flag.
 *
 * The problem it solves: a function needs something from its environment -
 * a logger, a transaction, a tenant id. Until now there were two ways, and
 * both come at a price:
 *
 *   a) pass it through   -> every signature along the way carries the
 *                           parameter, including the functions that never
 *                           touch it
 *   b) hold it as a field -> the class becomes stateful and harder to test
 *
 * Context parameters are the third way: the dependency is in the signature,
 * so it is visible and type-checked - but at the call site it is not passed,
 * it is resolved from the context.

/**
 * And here is the actual benefit: this function never uses the logger

    // Outside the block:
    //     restart(device)

    // not used here.
