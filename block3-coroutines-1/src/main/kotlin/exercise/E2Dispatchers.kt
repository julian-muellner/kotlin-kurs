/**
 * Exercise 2 - dispatchers: keeping blocking work off the thread of the caller.
 *
 * The functions below are blocking. They stand in for what you really find
 * in a code base: a JDBC driver, a file read, a legacy library, an HTTP
 * client without a suspending API.
 *
 * Calling them straight from a coroutine is the single most common mistake
 * when starting with coroutines: the coroutine no longer suspends, it
 * blocks - and with it the thread, and with that thread everything else
 * scheduled on it.
 *
 * Verify with:
 *     ./gradlew :block3-coroutines-1:exerciseTest --tests "exercise.E2*"

 *
 * Be aware of what the test can and cannot check: `Dispatchers.IO` and
 * `Dispatchers.Default` share the same thread pool, so the thread name
 * does not tell them apart and no test can verify your choice here. The
 * distinction is a design decision:
 *
 *   - IO may grow far beyond the core count, because its threads are
 *     expected to sit and wait.
 *   - Default is capped at the core count, because more parallel CPU work
 *     than you have cores buys nothing.
 *
 * Putting CPU work on IO lets dozens of threads fight over the same cores.
 * Putting blocking I/O on Default starves everything else.
